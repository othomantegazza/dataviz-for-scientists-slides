## 

This is not a comprehensive introduction to data visualization in javascript, it's just for breaking the ice.

## Javascript

::: {.column width="80%"}

Javascirpt (JS) Was developed as a programming language to run directly in the browser.

- It was released in 1995 by Brendan Eich,
- Javascript latest version is ECMAScript 6, abbreviated as ES6.
- Besides the name, it has nothing to do with Java.

Today javascript can run both in the browser (client side or front end), or independently from the browser, such as R (server side or back end).

## Javascript

::: {.column width="80%"}

Javascript is what makes things happen on web pages, and in many apps. It is a very widely used programming language.

## Try JS

You can try JS by opening the [browser console](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/). 

But most of the time it is easier to try it in dedicated tools, such as:

- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).
- [https://jsfiddle.net/](JS Fiddle)

Otherwise you can also install JS locally with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).



## CSS 

```
h1 {
  color: Black;
}

.bar {
  background: #0373fc;
  background-clip: content-box;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 5px #7f94ad;
  display: block;
  height: 20px;
  padding: 5px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  transition: width 0.5s cubic-bezier(1, 0.01, 0, 1);
}
```

## JS

```
const pop = [
  {
    "town": "Rome",
    "pop": 2.761,
  },
  {
    "town": "Milan",
    "pop": 1.352,
  },
  {
    "town": "Naples",
    "pop": 0.914,
  },
]

var tbl = document.getElementById("pop")

pop.forEach((town) => {
	 let html = `<tr>
   								<td>${town.town}</td>
                  <td class="bar" style="width:${town.pop*100}px;"></td>
                </tr>`
   console.log(town)
   tbl.insertAdjacentHTML( 'beforeend', html )
  }) 
```

## HTML

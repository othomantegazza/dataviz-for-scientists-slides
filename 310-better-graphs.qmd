When you draw a data visualization on a two dimensional screen, you map data variables to two types of graphical variables:

- Planar Variables: *x, y*.
- Retinal Variables: *colour, shape, orientation, size, area, texture*.

## Planar Variables



- x,y two linearly perceived variables, that you can use also for categorical ones.

## Retinal Variables

Colour (Hue and Value), Shape, Size, Orientation, Texture

## Colour

- colour ==> yes, use them, they make the graph nicer to see, you can encode continuous and categorica variables with them, with some caveat:

  - Daltonism or Colour blindness ==> Just test for it, use defined colour palettes.
  - Meanings associated to colours.
  - Perception. / lineaely percepted scales
  
colors are the on that can replace the x, y aesthetcs out of the box, in a highly nuanced way.

## Shape

Ok, also as double encoding, for printing etc.

## Size / Area, ok, how is it perceived?

Is it good for encoding uncertainty?

## Orientation

very specific

## Texture

cool for communication.

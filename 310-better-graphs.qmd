## Graphical Variables

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

When you draw a data visualization on a two dimensional screen, you map values from data variables to graphical variables:

- Planar Variables: *x, y*.
- Retinal Variables: *colour, shape, orientation, size, area, texture*.

In terms of the grammar of graphics, the graphical variables are the aesthetics that you map yor data to.

## Planar Variables

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

The x and y planar variables are largely perceived as a quantitative linear space. And they are great for representing **quantitative** and **qualitative** data.

The planar variables are the x and y coordinates on your planar screen, which readily translate to the x and y positions in your graph.

(f you use cartesian coordinates or to a transformed version of them if you use more elaborate coordinate systems)

## Retinal Variables

Colour (Hue and Value), Shape, Size, Orientation, Texture

## Colour

- colour ==> yes, use them, they make the graph nicer to see, you can encode continuous and categorica variables with them, with some caveat:

  - Daltonism or Colour blindness ==> Just test for it, use defined colour palettes.
  - Meanings associated to colours.
  - Perception. / lineaely percepted scales
  
colors are the on that can replace the x, y aesthetcs out of the box, in a highly nuanced way.

## Shape

Ok, also as double encoding, for printing etc.

## Size / Area, ok, how is it perceived?

Is it good for encoding uncertainty?

## Orientation

very specific

## Texture

cool for communication.

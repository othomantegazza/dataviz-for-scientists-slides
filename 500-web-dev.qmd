## Why Outputs For The Browser

- Free and open source.
- Best and most complete graphic tool available.
  - Full set of typographical tools.
  - Vector organization of shapes in space.
  - Transitions.
  - Interaction.

## Why Outputs For The Browser

Combination of elegant and consolidated open standards:

- **HTML** Text markup
- **CSS** Style (fonts, colors, pagination)
- **JS** Program in the browser

## Program in The Browser

::: {.column width=80%}

With Javascript you can run code on the front end.

This means that you can build data visualization directly on the reader's device:

It scales better, looks better, interacts better.

But it takes a lot of code to build a good data visualization with Javascript.

Let's try.

## Exercise

::: {.column width="80%"}

Use Javascript to change the content of this slides:

1. Open the [browser javascript console](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/).

2. Make a new variable that stores the string "Ciao!".

```js
var newContent = "Ciao!"
```

3. Select the content of this page, and change it to what's stored in **newContent**.

```js
document.getElementById('exercise').innerHTML = newContent
```

The content of the page was changed only on your device. If you reload it you'll get the original content back.

### Investigative Work 

Exploratory data analysis, as stated by Tukey, is the investigative work on data.

When you explore data, you leave no stone unturned. Relying on graphical methods, robust summary statistic and dimension reduction, you quickly gain insights in all possible patterns, correlations and cause-effect relationships that are in the data. In technical terms, you generate hypothesis.

### Confirmation

After you have done your investigative work, you should switch from inspector to judge and test your hypothesis with inference and tests.

But there's no point in testing the statistical relevance of poorly formulated hypotheses. Exploratory Data Analysis is fundamental in modern statistics, because it allows to formulate the best hypothesis possible.

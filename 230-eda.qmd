Author: John Tukey

Book: Exploratory Data Analysis

*The Boxplot is one of the main visual models used to explore data. It shows Summary Quantile Statistics and outlier for a stratified set of data.*

### Investigative Work 

Exploratory data analysis, as stated by Tukey, is the investigative work on data.

When you explore data, you leave no stone unturned. Relying on graphical methods, robust summary statistic and dimension reduction, you quickly gain insights in all possible patterns, correlations and cause-effect relationships that are in the data. In technical terms, you generate hypothesis.

### Confirmation

After you have done your investigative work, you should switch from inspector to judge and test your hypothesis with inference and tests.

But there's no point in testing the statistical relevance of poorly formulated hypotheses. Exploratory Data Analysis is fundamental in modern statistics, because it allows to formulate the best hypothesis possible.

When you explore data, you have to turn them into insightful formats. Most of the time this involves turning data into grafical and visual shapes.

STEM AND LEAF

Author: John Tukey

Book: Exploratory Data Analysis

*A graphical intuitive representation of car prices.*

A big part Tukey's book "Exploratory Data Analysis" relies on graphical representation of data that you can draw yourself with pen and paper. Luckily today you can use powerful software designed for data exploration purpose, such as the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

## Semantics

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

If you want to represent data intuitively, first you have to learn terms that allow you to describe the structure of a dataset semantically.

The [tidy data theory](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html) lets us do just that.

*A common framework to organize data semantically. If you organize data based on their structure, it's easier for you to make sense of them, to realize what data you have and what's missing.*

*If you organize data with a common framework, it's also easier to share them with others.*

- Each column is a variable.
- Each row is an observation.
- Each cell is a value.
- Each dataset is one observational unit.

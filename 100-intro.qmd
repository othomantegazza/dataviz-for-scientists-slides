## The [R Project]((https://www.r-project.org/)) for Statistical Computing

::: {.column width="70%"}

- Started in 1991 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland (NZ).
- Made open source in 1995.
- Official "peer reviewed" packages are hosted on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
- Has multiple "universes" of packages, including [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) dedicated to bioinformatics, and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for Data Science. 
- Great for analyzing data, for statistics, for research and for communicating data to others.

## A bit more on R

::: {.column width="70%"}

- We are going to use the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). But you might have to learn also a bit of the original idiom, now called base R, which sometimes helps if you have to programm your own functions.
-  [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is a great open source IDE dedicated to R. But you can use it also from [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any IDE of your choice.

## Resources 

::: {.column width="70%"}

If you need help, as always, Google and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?sort=MostVotes) are your friends.

But sometimes you need to learn on a support that is structured, nuanced and detailed, such as books. üìö

## A helpful and welcoming community üìö

::: {.column width="70%"}

One of the things that makes R great is its community of users and programmer.

It is **open source** and **open access** oriented and highly dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning R and data science, and make their tools available and usable to everyone.

- [R for Data Science Community](R https://www.rfordatasci.com/) a slack chanel for R networking.

<br>

### Blogs

- [Alison Hill's Blog](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/); great for everything Rmarkdown.

- [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/); modern statistics and R.

- [Julia Silge's Blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/); learn about R machine learning framework from one of its main developer.

- [Gina Reynolds Flipbooks](https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/2022-06-20-tabyl/2022-06-20-tabyl.html#1); for more tidyverse and Rmarkdown mastery.

- [Fornkonstin](https://fronkonstin.com/); at the interface between math, art and coding.

- [Data imaginist](https://www.data-imaginist.com/); more art in R üé®.

### Collaborative Challenges

- [Tidytuesday](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=github.com+tidytuesday) Tidy and visualize a dataset and share your results with the R community every week on Tuesday.

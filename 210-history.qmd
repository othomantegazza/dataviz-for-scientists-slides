## Wiliam Playfair (1759 â€“ 1823)

In [his words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair), commenting on how data were becoming ever more aboundant in life, and how data visualization (statistical diagrams) could help:

*"And it is hoped,that with the assistance of these Charts, such information will be got,
without the fatigue and trouble of studying the particulars of which it is composed."*

Maybe we've always known how to represent information visually, because that's the first and most intuitive way to do it.

## Abstraction

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Visual display of information

The graphical display of information, of words, of stories, of topology, has been part of human history as soon as the first pictures on rocks where drawn; and we know that they date back at least 50.000 years, probably more.

### Visual Abstraction

But data visualization requires some level of visual abstraction. We are not only drawing what we can see about the world. We are representing data visually, using abstract rules to draw something that did not exist before, and to leverage our visual perception to understand something that wasn't visual before.

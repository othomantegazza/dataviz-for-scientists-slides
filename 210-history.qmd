## Wiliam Playfair (1759 – 1823)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="37%"}
In [his words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair), commenting on how data were becoming ever more aboundant in life, and how data visualization (statistical diagrams) could help:

*"And it is hoped,that with the assistance of these Charts, such information will be got,
without the fatigue and trouble of studying the particulars of which it is composed."*

Maybe we've always known how to represent information visually, because that's the first and most intuitive way to do it.

*Hieroglyphs originated as logographyc symbols, and later evolved in syllabic and alphabetic elements, like these ones on the [Papirus of Ani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_of_Ani).*

*The [Bedolina Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedolina_Map) is one of the most ancient topographical map. It contains around 109 figures of paths, warriors, animals, and wooden huts.*

## Abstraction

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Visual display of information

The graphical display of information, of words, of stories, of topology, has been part of human history as soon as the first pictures on rocks where drawn; and we know that they date back at least 50.000 years, probably more.
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Visual Abstraction

But data visualization requires some level of visual abstraction. We are not only drawing what we can see about the world. We are representing data visually, using abstract rules to draw something that did not exist before, and to leverage our visual perception to understand something that wasn't visual before.
:::
::::

## But...

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

Visual and graphical representation of phenomena and data that are not inherently visual, existed well before the statistical diagrams of William Playfair. Can you think of some?

CLAY MAP OF NIPPUR

Year: ~1400 BC

Photo: [Hilprecht, H. V.](https://archive.org/details/cu31924019176217)

*In [ancient Babylonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia), maps were accurately drawn on clay tablets.*

Is a map an abstraction? One have to argue that what's represented in a map is definitely observable in real life, at least in theory. Though, very few of the people drawing maps had the chance to. They relied on measurements and data, representing them on the cartesian plane.

*[Musical Neumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neume#Western_plainchant) are one of the earliest graphical representation of music, drawing over vowels would represent the pitch and modulation in which the text shouldx be sung.*

*The [staff musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(music)), was developed in the last 1000 years. It represents graphically pitch timing and modulation of music, across 5 parallel lines.*

Colud it be one of the first way to abstract data and then represent them graphically in a new way?

## The Century of Science

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

In the 17th Century, interest for the natural sciences and disciplines such as astronomy, geography, physics, demographic, grew exponentially.

In that period, data visualization as we know i, was born under the name of "Statistical Diagrams".

## Two Builing Blocks

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

### Geometry and Coordinates

Analytical Geometry started with the work on the [Cartesian System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system).

In a plane, the cartesian system is a coordinate system that specifies each point univocally as a pair of real numbers, the distances from two perpendicular axes.

It was invented in parallel by Descartes and Fermat in 17th centurty.

::: {.column width="45%"}

### Probablility and Statistics

When people started to look with growing interest to the natural sciences a question rose: how can we improve our measurements? What can we expect from them.

Like this, [statistical approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics) were deployed first to reduce measurement errors in empirical measurements from Tycho Brahe. At the same time, Pascal and Fermat developed the first [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#History).

LONGITUDINAL DISTANCE TOLEDO-ROME

Author: [Michael van Langren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_van_Langren)

Year: 1640

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

*This [Longitudinal Distance Chart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grados_de_la_Longitud.jpg) represents separate measurements of the distance between Toledo and Rome. Each measurement is a labelled point on a x-axis of a one-dimensinal chart. All measurements overestimate the real distance, which is at ~16˚.*

:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

This chart contains so many ideas and concepts at once. The idea that measurements contain an error, that they can be repeated and pooled to infer this error, that they can be represented graphically to inspect this error using visual perception. 

The x-axis is well defined and labelled, the points show each single measurement, and are labelled also, the title is inserted in the empty space.

Author: [Christiaan Huygens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens)

*This density plot shows the age on the x-axis and the survival probability on the y-axis. Hygens estimated Survival probabilities from John Gaunt's life expectancy data in London.*

The graphs doesn't show data points but an empirical probability density.

GRAPHIC TABLE

Year:  1737

Author: [Johann Heinrich Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert)

*The temperature is represented on the x axis, while the y axis represents the month of the year. Lambert binned the data by this two variables, and counted how many days fell into each bin.*

Lambert positioned number in space based on the mappings of the x and y axis. Today we are used to map a color intensity to the count numeric value, in what would become a heatmap.

TABLEAU POLÉMETRIQUE

Year: 1782

Author: [Charles-René de Fourcroy de Ramecourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Ren%C3%A9_de_Fourcroy).

*In [this polymetric table](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tableau_Pol%C3%A9ometrique,_1782.jpg) the area of each polygon is proportional to the population of the main European cities.*

This is one of the first treemaps, in which the area of polygons is mapped to data, and then the polygons are fit in space of the page.

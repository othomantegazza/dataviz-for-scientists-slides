## Wiliam Playfair (1759 â€“ 1823)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="37%"}
In [his words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair), commenting on how data were becoming ever more aboundant in life, and how data visualization (statistical diagrams) could help:

*"And it is hoped,that with the assistance of these Charts, such information will be got,
without the fatigue and trouble of studying the particulars of which it is composed."*

Maybe we've always known how to represent information visually, because that's the first and most intuitive way to do it.

*Hieroglyphs originated as logographyc symbols, and later evolved in syllabic and alphabetic elements, like these ones on the [Papirus of Ani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_of_Ani).*

*The [Bedolina Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedolina_Map) is one of the most ancient topographical map. It contains around 109 figures of paths, warriors, animals, and wooden huts.*

## Abstraction

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Visual display of information

The graphical display of information, of words, of stories, of topology, has been part of human history as soon as the first pictures on rocks where drawn; and we know that they date back at least 50.000 years, probably more.

### Visual Abstraction

But data visualization requires some level of visual abstraction. We are not only drawing what we can see about the world. We are representing data visually, using abstract rules to draw something that did not exist before, and to leverage our visual perception to understand something that wasn't visual before.

## But...

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

Visual and graphical representation of phenomena and data that are not inherently visual, existed well before the statistical diagrams of William Playfair. Can you think of some?

CLAY MAP OF NIPPUR

*In [ancient Babylonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia), maps were accurately drawn on clay tablets.*

Is a map an abstraction? One have to argue that what's represented in a map is definitely observable in real life, at least in theory. Though, very few of the people drawing maps had the chance to. They relied on measurements and data, representing them on the cartesian plane.

MUSICAL NEUMES

Year: ~900 AD

Topic: Gregorian Chant

*[Musical Neumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neume#Western_plainchant) are one of the earliest graphical representation of music, drawing over vowels would represent the pitch and modulation in which the text shouldx be sung.*

*The [staff musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(music)), was developed in the last 1000 years. It represents graphically pitch timing and modulation of music, across 5 parallel lines.*

Colud it be one of the first way to abstract data and then represent them graphically in a new way?

## The Century of Science

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

In the 17th Century, interest for the natural sciences and disciplines such as astronomy, geography, physics, demographic, grew exponentially.

In that period, data visualization as we know i, was born under the name of "Statistical Diagrams".

### Geometry and Coordinates

Analytical Geometry started with the work on the [Cartesian System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system).

In a plane, the cartesian system is a coordinate system that specifies each point univocally as a pair of real numbers, the distances from two perpendicular axes.

It was invented in parallel by Descartes and Fermat in 17th centurty.

### Probablility and Statistics

When people started to look with growing interest to the natural sciences a question rose: how can we improve our measurements? What can we expect from them.

Like this, [statistical approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics) were deployed first to reduce measurement errors in empirical measurements from Tycho Brahe. At the same time, Pascal and Fermat developed the first [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#History).

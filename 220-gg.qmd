## Can you Describe a Graph?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

If we find a way to describe graphs systematically, then we can design and develop them more easily.

Most technical graphs can be declared with a system of rules called "Grammar of Grapihcs".

This system of rules is the basis for many data visualization packages, such as [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/).

The "Grammar of Graphics" was developed by [Leeland Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson).

It was later [extended](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) by Hadley Wickham, who started encoding it in the R package [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

The layered grammar of grapics states that:

- A default dataset and set of mappings from variables to aesthetics.
- One or more layers, with each layer having one geometric object, one statistical transformation, one position adjustment, and optionally, one dataset and set of aesthetic mappings.
- One scale for each aesthetic mapping used.
- A coordinate system.
- The facet specification.

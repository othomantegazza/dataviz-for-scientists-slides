## Can you Describe a Graph?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

If we find a way to describe graphs systematically, then we can design and develop them more easily.

Most technical graphs can be declared with a system of rules called "Grammar of Grapihcs".

This system of rules is the basis for many data visualization packages, such as [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/).

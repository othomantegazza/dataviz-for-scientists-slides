## Let's Try it

::: {.column width="70%"}

This is one of the most hands on section of the workshop. The best way to learn how to use this publishing tool, is to use it.

SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION ON THE DISCOVERY OF COLOUR BLINDNESS

Author: John Dalton

Year: 1794

Source: [Hathi Trust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011812155)

*The father of the atomic theory John Dalton, realized that people might perceive colour differently and devised an experiment to test it. Discovering colour blindness, and that he was colour blind himself,*

Early scientific publications where in the shape of carefully crafted, extensively discursive booklets. Obviously, printed on paper.

:::

## Scientific Publishing

::: {.column width="70%"}

The main form of publication for a scientist still is the article on peer reviewed journals.

Although, as a scientist, you will find yourself communicating your work in many channels, such as reports, blog posts, presentations, books.

Or videos, posts on social media that unfortunately we will not cover here.

None of them less important than the peer reviewed article for making sure that your work reaches the people that need it and have an impact.

:::

## Literate Programming

![](img/literate-prog-flow.svg){.absolute top=120 left=0} 

::: {.absolute top=500 left=0}

::: {.column width="70%"}

Literate programming is a paradigm that allows us to mix analytic code and markup natural language. The main R tools for it a [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and now [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

We will use Quarto.

:::

:::

## Data Driven Documents

::: {.column width="70%"}

As a quantitative scientist, your publications will often be data driven. 

To make a data driven report, your best choice is to prepare documents with in which text and analytic code are tightly knit together, in this way you don't have to update the results manually if the starting data or the analytic code change on the way.

This will make your analyses more reproducible.

:::

## Markdown

Markdown is an extremely simplified markup language. Also known is [WYSIWYM](https://xkcd.com/1341/): what you see is what you mean. When you write in Quarto you use markdown.

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/types_of_editors_2x.png){.absolute top=250 left=0}

## Two Editor Paradigms

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="47%"}

### WYSIWYG

What you see is what you get: while your write, on your screen, you see formatted text. If you want to break a paragraph you see a paragraph break, if you want italic text you see italic text and so on.

For sure you have used WYSIWYG editors, such as Microsoft Words, or [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/).

:::

::: {.column width="47%"}

### WYSIWYM

What you see is what you mean: both body text and its formatting are expressed in text. You might have experience with it if you have used [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

In HTML, if you want to write *hello* in italic, you write:

`<em>hello<\em>`

When you write in WYSIWYM,you use markup languages.

:::

:::

## Markdown

::: {.column width="70%"}

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup language that's simple and easy to read.

```md
# This is a title

## This is level 2 title

### This is a level 3 title

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

Another paragraph with [a link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

```

:::

## More Markdown

```md

1. This is
1. A numbered
1. List

And:

- This is
- A Bullet
- List

```

## More Markdown

```md
You can also insert images:

![](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#/media/File:Nacreous_clouds_Antarctica.jpg)

And add tables

| First Column | Second Column |
|--------------|---------------|
| Content   1A | Content    1B |
| Content   2A | Content    2B |

> Indented Quote

```

## Exercise

::: {.column width="70%"}

Use this [online markdown editor](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) to reproduce (by copying and pasting) the main content of [R for Data Science's Chapter on Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto). 

Try to reproduce all formatting, such a bold text, lists, code blocks. Add the functional links.

If needed, get help [this markdown guide](https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html) or any manual and forum that you find and like.

## My Quarto Project Structure

![](img/quarto-structure.png){.absolute top=110 left=550 width="450px"}

::: {.column width="47%"}

This is the project structure that I use for Quarto, when I work on web based project (such as these slides).

You can download a starter folder with this structure from [this Github repo](https://github.com/othomantegazza/quarto-starter).

:::

## More Info

::: {.column width="70%"}

For more information on Quarto, please follow the tutorial on [Quarto's website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html), they are very clear and well done.

:::

## Exercise

::: {.columns width="70%"}

Try Quarto:

1. Install [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) on your computer.
2. Download and unzip the [quarto-starter folder](https://github.com/othomantegazza/quarto-starter) from this Github repo.
3. On your computer, open the file **quarto-starter.Rproj** in Rstudio.
4. Serve the Quarto project locally, by typing at the terminal console:

```sh
quarto preview
```

5. On [your browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) open the local host [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to preview your quarto project.
6. Open the file **index.qmd** in rstudio, edit it, save your results. See how the preview in the browser changes accordingly. 

:::

## Files in Quarto Projects

::: {.columns width="70%"}

The main files in a web based Quarto projects are:

- _quarto.yaml
- index.qmd
- Any other .qmd files

:::

## _quarto.yml

**\_quarto.yml** is a configuration file in [YAML format](https://yaml.org/):

```{r echo = FALSE}
cat(readr::read_file("data/quarto-yml-example.yml"))
```

## index.qmd

::: {.column width=70%}

**index.qmd** is the quarto file that produce the page that stands at the root (home page) of your website.

```{r echo = FALSE}
cat(readr::read_file("index.qmd"))
```

:::

## Style

::: {.column width=70%}

If the output of your project is web based, you can style it with [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), or [SCSS](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.html).

CSS or SCSS are a complex but powerful tool to style the web, you can style each HTML element by name.

For example, style the main title with:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: Noto Serif, Serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 50px; 
}
```

You can find an example in the folder **style/custom.scss**.

:::

## Inspect HTML elements

::: {.column width=47%}

In [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), you can open the page inspector with 

- **Ctrl + Shift + C** on Windows or Linux.
- **Cmd + Shift + C** on Mac OS.

You can use it to identify the name of the page elements that you want to style.

## Exercise 

::: {.column width=70%}

Explore data in your own web based Quarto project.

You can choose to start from:

- Downloading this [example Quarto project](https://github.com/othomantegazza/quarto-example), which you can find [deployed here](https://quarto-demo.otho.app/). Give a look at this option also as an example of what you can do.
- From the empty [Quarto Starter](https://github.com/othomantegazza/quarto-starter), which we used in the previous exercise.
- By [starting your own Quarto project](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html), in Rstudio, from scratch. 

More info on next page...

:::

## Exercise 

::: {.column width=70%}

...chose some data that you would like to analyze and report on them, combining data visualization, and text.

On data, you have many options:

- Schengen [statistics on short stay visa](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/visa-policy_en), which are already included in the [example Quarto project](https://github.com/othomantegazza/quarto-example).

- This dataset on [microchip development](https://chip-dataset.vercel.app/).

- Any dataset from previous exercises, that you liked and that you would like to keep working on.

Feel free to experiment with Quarto, to modify styles, headers and settings, don't be afraid to brack things.

:::

## Exercise 

(EXTRA)

Publish your results online in a website.

1. Make a free [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com).
2. Start a new website from manual deploy.
3. Drag and drop the **docs/** folder of your quarto project into Netlify and see it go live online.

Watch out! everything that's in the **docs/** folder will become public, check that you did not include any sensitive personal information in your analysis.

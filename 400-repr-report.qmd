## Let's Try it

::: {.column width="70%"}

This is one of the most hands on section of the workshop. The best way to learn how to use this publishing tool, is to use it.

SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION ON THE DISCOVERY OF COLOUR BLINDNESS

Author: John Dalton

Year: 1794

Source: [Hathi Trust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011812155)

*The father of the atomic theory John Dalton, realized that people might perceive colour differently and devised an experiment to test it. Discovering colour blindness, and that he was colour blind himself,*

Early scientific publications where in the shape of carefully crafted, extensively discursive booklets. Obviously, printed on paper.

## Scientific Publishing

::: {.column width="70%"}

The main form of publication for a scientist still is the article on peer reviewed journals.

Although, as a scientist, you will find yourself communicating your work in many channels, such as reports, blog posts, presentations, books.

Or videos, posts on social media that unfortunately we will not cover here.

None of them less important than the peer reviewed article for making sure that your work reaches the people that need it and have an impact.

## Literate Programming

![](img/literate-prog-flow.svg){.absolute top=120 left=0} 

::: {.absolute top=500 left=0}

::: {.column width="70%"}

Literate programming is a paradigm that allows us to mix analytic code and markup natural language. The main R tools for it a [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and now [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

We will use Quarto.

## Data Driven Documents

::: {.column width="70%"}

As a quantitative scientist, your publications will often be data driven. 

To make a data driven report, your best choice is to prepare documents with in which text and analytic code are tightly knit together, in this way you don't have to update the results manually if the starting data or the analytic code change on the way.

This will make your analyses more reproducible.

## Markdown

Markdown is an extremely simplified markup language. Also known is [WYSIWYM](https://xkcd.com/1341/): what you see is what you mean. When you write in Quarto you use markdown.

## Two Editor Paradigms

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="47%"}

### WYSIWYG

What you see is what you get: while your write, on your screen, you see formatted text. If you want to break a paragraph you see a paragraph break, if you want italic text you see italic text and so on.

For sure you have used WYSIWYG editors, such as Microsoft Words, or [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/).

:::

::: {.column width="47%"}

### WYSIWYM

What you see is what you mean: both body text and its formatting are expressed in text. You might have experience with it if you have used [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) or [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

In HTML, if you want to write *hello* in italic, you write:

`<em>hello<\em>`

When you write in WYSIWYM,you use markup languages.

## Markdown

::: {.column width="70%"}

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a markup language that's simple and easy to read.

```md
# This is a title

## This is level 2 title

### This is a level 3 title

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

Another paragraph with [a link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

```

:::

## More Markdown

```md

1. This is
1. A numbered
1. List

And:

- This is
- A Bullet
- List

```

## More Markdown

```md
You can also insert images:

![](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#/media/File:Nacreous_clouds_Antarctica.jpg)

And add tables

| First Column | Second Column |
|--------------|---------------|
| Content   1A | Content    1B |
| Content   2A | Content    2B |

> Indented Quote

```

## Exercise

::: {.column width="70%"}

Use this [online markdown editor](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) to reproduce (by copying and pasting) the main content of [R for Data Science's Chapter on Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto). 

Try to reproduce all formatting, such a bold text, lists, code blocks. Add the functional links.

If needed, get help [this markdown guide](https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html) or any manual and forum that you find and like.

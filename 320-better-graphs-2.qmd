*A highly specialized diagnostic visual model used in the omics disciplines.*



*He designed the concept of climate stripes, removing everything that's not a direct mapping of data from an heatmap of average temperature.*

On the x axis, each stripe is a year, from the year when the first data recording is available reliably.

The colour represents the relative change in temperature.

The y axis is not mapped to the data.

When you explore your data, your goal should be very fast and produce many informative graphs from your data.

When you want to communicate results to other, you goal should be to make as few graphs as possible that can inform your audience.

As a scientist, the most likely scenario would be that you are communicating very complex results to an highly educated and informed audience.

Obviously, you should craft your message analyzing your data rigorously.

Be sure to make few graphs, which convey a message that you want to get through to your audience.

The goal of a data visualization in scientific communication is to convey a message. That message should be clear to yourself, first of all, and then clear to your audience. 

To help inform your audience, add as many details you can into your data visualization, but not too many. They should not overcrowd your message.

## Show the Data

- As much as you can, as nuanced as you can.
- If it can be turned into a table, is to simple.
- If the message isn't clear, is too complex

## Declutter

## Spatial organization, ordering

## Gestalt Prangranz
